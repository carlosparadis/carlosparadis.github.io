Aloha! Welcome to my personal space. This space is inspired by Distill's notion of [research debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/) and the [Illustrated BERT](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/). It is a self-exercise in building paths and staircases through the mountains I climbed or sharing those seen in the wild. As the saying goes, the opinions expressed here are my own and not necessarily the views of my employer.
